# Java Algorithm Programs

This folder contains a collection of algorithm programs implemented in Java. These programs cover a range of fundamental algorithms commonly used in computer science and software development. Specifically, it includes implementations for the following algorithms:

## Algorithms Included

1. **Knapsack Algorithm**
   - Find the optimal selection of items in a knapsack problem given their weights and values.

2. **Bi-Infinite Turing Machine**
   - Implement a bi-infinite Turing machine, a theoretical computational model, in Java.

3. **Shuffle**
   - Solve the shuffle string matrix matching problem using Java, a combinatorial problem in graph theory.

4. **Knight's Tour**
   - Find a solution to the Knight's Tour problem, where a knight must visit every square of a chessboard exactly once.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the specific algorithm folder you're interested in.
2. Open the Java source file (`.java`) for the algorithm.
3. Study the Readme.md files
